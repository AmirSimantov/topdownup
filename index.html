As a result of my many deliberations with him, I learned a great deal about what I wanted to achieve in the first place and what more the database could do for me. Amir's intellectual curiosity, selfless dedication, uncompromising eye for details, rigorous documentation, and ability to think ahead allowed him to become the conscience of the project, often veering my team and me in the right direction and saving us from betraying our own goals and principles. I cannot imagine the  project without him."</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Let's Work Together!</h2>
            <p class="mb-8 font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 lg:text-xl">I build an online database by following an adequately administered process involving the data curators and the technical team. By joining hands, I ensure that I use the technology skillfully to address the specific requirements of your collection. You are always involved and informed during the process. The process is flexible to your needs, and I will happily cater to your needs within the confines of the standing procedures. Listed below are the stages I usually follow in the process of turning your data into a “live” digital database.</p>
    
        <div class="space-y-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2 sm:gap-6 lg:space-y-0">

            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">First Discussion</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">In our initial one-hour video meeting, I make sure that I can indeed serve your needs. I get to understand briefly what your datasets are (findings, documents, etc.), what you expect the online collection to achieve, and what your long-term goals are (even your greatest expectations regarding the research or database). If we decide to work together, we move on to the next stage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Specifying Structure</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">You know best what your data objects are and the relationship among them. I will apply this knowledge correctly and funnel it into a computerized system. This process is called "data modeling," in which you are fully involved. You do not need technical knowledge. During our discussions, you provide the necessary information, and we put it to work. We will also discuss your future needs as we are designing the system (even if we don't implement them in the first phase of your project).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Specifying Behavior</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">I want to give users an efficient method of using the database. We define the types of users who can use the site and classify their needs. We then define the ways users search for data and how it is best to serve them the results. We also specify how data contributors are authorized to add data to the database and the way the data can be edited and published.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Specifying Presentation</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">You want your online database to be attractive and user-friendly. At this stage, we bring in a graphic designer who makes sure that the essence of the database is understood. You may provide links to websites whose graphics you like as a general reference for the look and feel of your online database. The graphic designer comes up with suggestions that you can accept, reject, or ask to change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Building</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">My team and I can now begin constructing the online database. During this stage, I supply you with alternative system configurations. These are usually more minor issues that we did not finalize in previous stages. We have regular meetings where I can explain the alternatives, answer your questions, and share our progress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Testing</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Once built, we put the database online at a web address known only to you. You then see what it looks like and behaves, testing it using the specified user types. In this stage, you will probably find bugs that we did not catch ourselves; you report them, and I fix them. You can also request some small, last-minute changes, and if at all possible, we will try to make them in this stage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Migrating</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">You may have an existing database in another format, such as an older website, spreadsheets, structured documents, etc. We discuss which datasets to import into the new database and the best way to do so. We do that while maintaining the relationship among the existing data records and preserving the coherence of the new database. We do another round of testing to enable you to check the actual results of the data import and confirm it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Going live</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">You or your peers can now add data to the well-structured database via the easy-to-use interface. You decide whether to make it publicly accessible (and accessible to search engines like Google) or, if you prefer, to restrict it to your peers, who can enter with a username and password. The database is designed and built to serve you permanently and is now active – it can grow both in size and in the number of collaborating contributors.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Support</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">I offer ongoing support for clients if they need it. A modern digital database is a "living creature" which should be properly maintained. It includes mostly behind-the-scene operations such as security updates, small server tweaks, etc. I am also available for you if you have any questions or want to discuss new ideas.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-col max-width-lg text-gray-900 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
            <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Evolving</h3>
            <p class="font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">I supply documentation files for all the specification stages and the building stage, so you are free to choose your service provider. If you find me suitable and are happy with the services I offer, we can continue working together. A few months after the database has gone live online, you may have more ideas for improving it. We can enhance its performance, change aspects of its presentation and add new content types to its structure.</p>

He was accessible and on-task, and he regularly discussed everything with us, down to minor details. We are now thanking him for his insistence on separating structure, content, and presentation and for his patient explanations: we found that Amir designed a database that made it easy to work with complex relations. It was robust and flexible enough to accommodate even unexpected sources of data."</p>

He helped me establish, under enormous time pressure, a prototype of an academic digital research tool that far exceeded my expectations, also allowing room for potential future developments of which I hadn't thought initially. His devotion and work capacities are exceptional, as well as his dedication to the project. Amir's flexibility and originality also helped surmise obstacles whenever they occurred, and he was fully aware and sensitive to time and budgetary constraints. In short, Amir combines intelligence, creativity, hard work, and an attentive ear to the customer's needs. Without his support, I could not have made my vision come to life, and I warmly recommend his services."</p>
